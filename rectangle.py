#First, we need to bring in the turtle "module" to create turtle graphics
import turtle

#Let's set the turtle screen's background color!
turtle.bgcolor("black")

#Now, create a new turtle pen and give it a name
toby = turtle.Pen()

#Set the color of the pen
toby.pencolor("green")

#Set the width of the pen
#(i.e. how fat a line the pen will draw)
toby.width(2)

#Move the pen forward to draw a line.
#The number in the parentheses is how long it will be in pixels
toby.forward(200)

#Turn the pen left by 90 degrees

#Move the pen forward to draw a line 40 pixels long.
